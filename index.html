            <h2>Athletes: Men vs Women</h2>
            <img src="images/menvswomen.png" alt="Men vs Women">
            <p>From the results of this graph one can deduce that the Canadian Olympics team has over 100 more men than women. The graph shows 61.8% male and 38.2% women, which may seem like a large split, however their are a total of 386 men and 239 women, which is a lot of participants from each gender. A factor that could result in this could be boys playing sports from earlier ages and playing them throughout their childhood, leading them to want to be apart of the olympics.</p>

                <img src="images/medals1990.png" alt="Medals 1990">
                <p>The visualization from this chart depicts how after 1990 the gold and silver medal category almost tripled in its totals. Looking at this data we can argue that training efficiency and experience could be large factors to such success. We can also argue that PED's (Performance Enhancing Drugs) might have also been a reason during the late 90's or early 2000's. Overall one could conclude with finite evidance that expereince and training have aided in Canadian gold and silver medal success.</p>

                <p>The 3 graphs comparing Canada and the US's medal placing highlight how the US is dominating Canada in the Bronze and Silver categories by 60.9% and 61.1% respectively. However in the gold category Canada is dominating by 65.4%. Using this information we can see how Canada places 1st in a lot more events than the US, which overall is a more accurate representation of Canada's abilities than overall medals. Canada is over 150 gold medals ahead of USA, behind by just over 100 medals in silver, and behind by exactly 60 bronze medals. Canada can easily take over the number one spot of overall medals if they keep on this upward trend (see graph 2) over the next few olympic.</p>
